## Introduction
```{r}
DMPs$cg_id <- rownames(DMPs)
```

```{r}
DMPs_overlap <- find_overlaps(as_granges(DMPs), as_granges(bsseq_dmrs)) %>% data.frame()
```
```{r}
nrow(DMPs_overlap)
length(unique(DMPs_overlap$rank))
```

```{r}
gst_array_overlap <- gometh(sig.cpg=DMPs_overlap[1:10000,]$cg_id, all.cpg=DMPs_overlap$cg_id, collection="GO",
              plot.bias=TRUE)
