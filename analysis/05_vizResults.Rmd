* maybe have an itty bit of this in exploreCpGGST - as an exploratory: and if any systems have more CpGs in them already
* it would be nice to have a hierachy map with all of this to see how the gene sets are related
(I know I looked into a few things back in the day, see if I can find them)

* can't find what the packages were that I tried to do hierachy stuff with
oh yeah it was [gosemsim](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/GOSemSim.html)
and also just googled
[go.db](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/annotation/html/GO.db.html) - this one can show all the child terms of a term
[viseago](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ViSEAGO.html) - another semantic similarity one
[rrvgo](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/rrvgo/inst/doc/rrvgo.html)
I think what I'm interested in this stuff is looking at the results overall and ways to do that and summarise those more elegantly than top 10
and just general understanding
I think this visualising is another file lol
