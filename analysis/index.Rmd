Welcome to my research website.

The main analyses conducted uses B cell type and NK cell type samples, 
under the hg19 genome annotation.
* Microarray: EPICv1 platform. [GSE110554](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE110554)
* WGBS [GSE186458](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE186458)


* Initial analysis and development of GST methods was done on results from bsseq.
* This was the method that ran and worked well.
* When revisiting analysis - retried DMRcate and it ran (didn't initially).
* It was attractive as it had a method for array and seq, and found less DMRs (bsseq was very noisy)
* original microarray analysis was done with minfi - and then repeated with DMRcate
* results from both methods will be included in the various steps - as the original development, and as the subsequent analysis.
